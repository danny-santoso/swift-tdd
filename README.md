# Test Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process where developers write automated tests for a new piece of functionality before writing the actual code to implement it.

The TDD process typically follows these steps:

1. Write a failing test: The developer writes an automated test that tests a small piece of functionality that is not yet implemented. This test should fail because the functionality it is testing does not yet exist.
2. Write the code: The developer writes the code necessary to make the test pass. This code should be written with the goal of passing the test, and no more.
3. Refactor the code: Once the test passes, the developer refactors the code to make it cleaner and more maintainable. This step is optional but highly recommended.
4. Repeat: The developer repeats this process for each piece of functionality that needs to be implemented.
